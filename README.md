##  Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Tkinter is included with most Python distributions.

To verify Tkinter is installed:

```bash
python -m tkinter
```

If it doesn’t open a test window, you can install it (Linux only):

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```



###  Run the App

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PasswordAnalyzer.git
   cd PasswordAnalyzer
   ```

2. **Run the App**
   
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```



##  Usage

1. Type your password in the input box.
2. Click **“Analyze Password”**.
3. View the strength and suggestions.
4. Use the **“Show”** button to reveal or hide your password.



##  Password Best Practices

For a strong password:
- Use at least **12 characters**
- Combine **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Avoid common patterns like `123`, `password`, `qwerty`
- Use **passphrases** instead of single words
